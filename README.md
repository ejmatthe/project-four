# project-four
This was a group project worked on by Eric Matthews, Samson Zewde and Sean Seaforth. It is a continued exploration of suicide rates, utilizing different tools at different points.
## Background and Scope
For this project, we changed our focus slightly. We decided to look at worldwide data, as opposed to the United States specific data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Instead, we utilized a combined dataset sourced from Kaggle (the citations for the sources used by the creator of that set are also included in our data sources section below). It included the country, year, sex and the GDP's country. This allowed us to explore trends on a global basis, as well as a sizable amount of data in order to create a machine learning model. 
## Data Sourcing and Cleaning

## Creating the Machine Learning Model

## Visualizing the Data and Creating Dashboards
    Utilizing Tableau for a visualizations, we wanted to show the domestic suicide 
    rates in comparison to the world suicide rates. Within that comparison, we 
    looked at suicide rates, not only by country, but also by gender. You will also 
    notice that we did the percentage of suicides per country based on total 
    suicides in the world.
